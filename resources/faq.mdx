## Liquidity & Trading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's this 'virtual liquidity' magic?">

    Only the standard 1% LP fee on all trades (0.5% to creator, 0.5% to protocol). No platform fees, no hidden charges, no extra costs!
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is the liquidity really locked forever?">
    Yes! 100% of initial liquidity is permanently locked in our contracts. No rug pulls possible.

## Safety & Security

<AccordionGroup>
