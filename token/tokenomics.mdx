## 🎁 Creator Migration Program

<Info>
**Not a vampire attack** - This is a welcome bonus for creators building on Slinq!

## 🔒 Staking & esSLINQ

Stake your SLINQ tokens to earn **esSLINQ** (escrowed SLINQ) and additional rewards.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stake SLINQ" icon="lock" color="#00D26A">
    Lock your tokens to start earning rewards immediately
  </Card>
  <Card title="Earn esSLINQ" icon="gem" color="#00D9FF">
    Receive non-transferable esSLINQ as staking rewards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Convert to SLINQ" icon="rotate" color="#FFD700">
    Vest or instant-claim your esSLINQ for SLINQ
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What is esSLINQ?

esSLINQ (escrowed SLINQ) is a **non-transferable** reward token that can be converted to SLINQ through:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="21-Day Vesting">
    **Full Value Path** - Get 100% of your esSLINQ as SLINQ

    - Lock esSLINQ for 21 days
    - Claim SLINQ linearly as it vests
    - No penalties - receive the full amount
    - Best for long-term holders

    ```
    100 esSLINQ → 21 days → 100 SLINQ
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Instant Claim">
    **Quick Access** - Get 45% immediately

    - Claim esSLINQ instantly at 45% rate
    - 55% penalty is applied
    - Penalty split: 50% burned, 50% recycled to staking rewards
    - Best for immediate liquidity needs

    ```
    100 esSLINQ → Instant → 45 SLINQ
                          → 27.5 Burned
                          → 27.5 Back to Stakers
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Staking Economics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are rewards distributed?" icon="chart-line">
    Rewards stream linearly over 24-hour periods. The longer you stake, the more you earn relative to others. When new rewards are deposited, they combine with remaining rewards and redistribute over a fresh 24-hour window.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the penalty recycling mechanism?" icon="recycle">
    When users instant-claim esSLINQ at 45%, the 55% penalty is split:
    - **50% burned** - reducing total supply permanently
    - **50% recycled** - sent back to the staking pool as additional rewards

    This creates a sustainable reward flywheel where impatient users boost rewards for patient stakers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel vesting early?" icon="xmark">
    Yes! You can cancel a vesting position at any time:
    - Claim any SLINQ already vested
    - Receive unvested esSLINQ back to your wallet
    - Start a new vesting position or instant-claim the returned esSLINQ
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many vesting positions can I have?" icon="list">
    You can have up to **30 active vesting positions** at once. Completed positions can be cleaned up to free slots and receive a gas refund.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 🔥 Buyback & Burn

A portion of protocol fees are used to **buy back SLINQ** from the market and **permanently burn** it.

<div style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.1) 0%, rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.1) 100%)', borderRadius: '16px', padding: '24px', marginBottom: '24px' }}>

| Source | Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Trading Fees (Protocol Share) | Buyback SLINQ via PancakeSwap | Reduces circulating supply |
| Instant Claim Penalties | 50% burned directly | Reduces total supply |
| Deflationary Pressure | Continuous burns | Increasing scarcity |
